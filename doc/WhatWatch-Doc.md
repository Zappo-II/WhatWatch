# WhatWatch Documentation

## About

This is a gnome-shell-extension. It displays an analog clock on the desktop and exposes a great variety of customisation options.

## General Usage

The clock is non interactive. If you set it up to be non opaque you'll be able to see any controls hidden behind it. The clock acts as if it was not there in case you click on something behind it.

## Configuration

Use the extensions app of gnome-shell to activate / deactivate the extension or to launch it's settings dialog.

The settings dialog will expose quite a bunch of parameters and attributes of the clock to be configured.
